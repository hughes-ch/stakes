    Stakes
</h1>

The high-stakes social media app powered by IPFS and the Ethereum blockchain.

Users must buy into the app by purchasing the ERC20 Karma token. From there, all transactions are paid for with this token instead of the user's ETH balance. Users can post content, follow others, and support their favorite content by adding Karma to it. If they like a piece of content enough, they can outright buy it from another so it is added to their own collection. The best part is that content isn't limited to this platform. Since content is a full ERC721 token, it can be traded in any NFT marketplace. 

Stakes is currently hosted (and is always planned to be hosted) on the Rinkeby test network. See it [here](https://stakes.chrishughesdev.com)!
